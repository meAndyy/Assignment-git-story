<h1>Chapter 3 </h1>
<p>Cpl. Asquith quickly took up a defensive position and surveyed the surrounding area.The Zepplin was closing in on his position faster then previously thought. He didnt know what to do. How do you destroy a 300ft airship 1000m above your head? Through his binoculers he could see the anti aircraft battery open fire on the airship. The team of three men were keeping up a rapid rate of fire against the Zepplina but te distance between them was too great and most of the rounds had fallen short. The battle was raginng all around them, the pickelhaube poking up from the adjacent trenchs. He had to think fast...How to lure the zepplin closer to the aircraft battery where we can start doing some real damage.

<p>He ran along the trench line skipping over the corpses of comrades and enemies alike. The chatter of machine gun fire grew louder and louder, at this stage he was passed fear, passed caring, he just wanted it all to be over. In his haste he turned the corner and et head first with the source of the chatter. A german two man machine gun team the distance between them not more than five feet. The Cpl grabbed his standard issue webley revolver and put two rounds in the closest german machine gunner, The second gunner was lucky, Asquith pistol jammed and he used his own pistol to shoot Asquith in his arm. Asquith fell to the ground the warm blood mixing with the mud beneath him. The german soldier holstered his pistol and toom out his long, thin trench knife. He spun it on his finger and then walked toward Asquith. He crocuhed beside him and whispered "Nighty night Tomm---". But these were his last words, Asquith had a knife of his own, hidden is his boot. He plunged it into his chin and qhickly took it out and out it back in his boot.

<p>The Cpl himself noticed what the men had been defending, an anti aircraft gun. He quickly mad his way over and loaded some shells in the weapon. The Zepplin was very close, nearly over his head at this stage. He knew that he had to be accurate with his shots if not the zepplin will drop his bombs. Where to pick his shot though he thought? should he aim for the engine at the back or should he try shoot the main under carriage. He took aim and fired 6 rounds, the first 3 missed but the others made their mark. The under carriage swung violently and one of the supports snapped leaving it swinging underneath. He knew he had the now. He reloaded and fired again. KABOOMMMMM. He aimed for the gap in the trap left by the undercarriage and the round hit a tank of hydrogen gas. The zepplins fire swallowed up the sky. He slumped down leaning his back against the trench wall getting his well earned rest. He took out a pen and paper to wrote a letter to his girl waiting at home. But he was interrrupted by a whistle, a bugle and sound of a thousand rifles goin off and with that it started all over again.
