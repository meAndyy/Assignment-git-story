<h1>Chapter 3 </h1>
<p>The HQ was flattened before his heart beat twice. A huge fireball erupted and knocked the corporal off his feet. Every breath scorched his lungs, feroicously hard to draw a breath and splinters of metal and debris were lodged in his extremities.His ears rang and he could feel the blood on his face..."Is this the end?" he thought to himself. He brought himself to his knees looked around at the devestation. All his friends were dead and for what ? For King and country or for the women and children. No, only to staisfy the the war mongering elite with there bloody tiffs and spats. A whole generation of men wiped out.
</p>

<p>The corporal rolled into a nearby trench. He lay in the mud before getting to his feet. He stumbled through the trench looking for any signs of life. Throught the rubble and the debris and smoke it was hard to make out a face. As he turned the corner he stopped suddenly, there was a german soldier sitting, leaning against the trench wall. His leg was wounded very badly. The two looked at eah other in the eye, each one waiting fr the first move. After wht seemed like an eternity the german soldier threw down his pistol, he had clearly had enought. Asquith slowly lowered his rifle. Took out his cigrettes and threw one to the german. 
</p>

<p>The two men sat beside each other in the trench, from opposite sides of the conflict to that trench in no mans land. There was no hatred or animosity between the two men, they knew they were both just following orders. They sat and watched the plumes of the smoke and listened to the chatter of machine gun fire. They joked in broken english and german and shared their rations with each other. God knows how long they sat in each others company but it seemed like forever. Asquith patched up his new german friends leg for him, stopping the bleeding with a tourniquet. So what now they thought? Should they just wait it out and see who comes for them. Asquith didnt want to leave his new friend behind. They felt like they had known each other forver. Suddenly, a whistle blasts, a bugle sounds , the artillery opens fire and it strated all over again.
