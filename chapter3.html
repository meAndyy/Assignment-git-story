How do you destroy a 300ft airship 1000m above your head? Through his binoculers he could see the anti aircraft battery open fire on the airship. The team of three men were keeping up a rapid rate of fire against the Zepplina but te distance between them was too great and most of the rounds had fallen short. The battle was raginng all around them, the pickelhaube poking up from the adjacent trenchs. He had to think fast...How to lure the zepplin closer to the aircraft battery where we can start doing some real damage.

The chatter of machine gun fire grew louder and louder, at this stage he was passed fearmpassed caring, he just wanted it all to be over. In his haste he turned the corner and et head first with the source of the chatter. A german two man machine gun team the distance between them not more than five feet. The Cpl grabbed his standard issue webley revolver and put two rounds in the closest german machine gunner, The second gunner was lucky, Asquith pistol jammed and he used his own pistol to shoot Asquith in his arm. Asquith fell to the ground the warm blood mixing with the mud beneath him. The german soldier holstered his pistol and toom out his long, thin trench knife. He spun it on his finger and then walked toward Asquith. He crocuhed beside him and whispered "Nighty night Tomm---".
