<h1>Chapter 2 </h1>
<p>As the shell lies smoking from its seams, Cpl. Asquith has to make the decision. The only way around the bomb is to go directly over it. To turn back could mean death, without the message how will hq know to shell the Regiments retreat ? Without the Artillery the Jerrys will tear our boys to peices. Cpl. Asquith runs and leaps over the bomb. The trench is narrow and he skins his elbows off the wall. His back tenses and his chin tucks in expecting the bomb to go off but so far so good. Not daring to look back he quickly trudges through the ankle deep mud.</p>

<p>The Corporal counts his lucky stars, this is not the first time he had danced with the devil. He had been on the frontline since the start. He remembered so well how he and his friends had romanticized the war, the great advanture of our time they called it. To bring home tales of adventure and glory was all they had ever dreamed about and they were promised to be home for christmas....but that never happened. This war was far worse then any before it. Now there calling it "The war to end all wars"
